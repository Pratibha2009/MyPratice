Patterns for Coding problems: 
1. Prefix Sum pattern  - Wherever we need subarray sum in constant time complexity O(1)
2. Two Pointers pattern -  
3. Sliding Window pattern - you need to return a subarray satisfying some condition . 
4. Fast and slow pointers - used to find cycle in a linked list, or middle node in a linked list etc.
5. Monotonic stack - it is used to find the next greater or next smaller element in the array. 
6. Top 'k' elements pattern - use heap 
7. Overlapping intervals pattern - 
8. Modified binary search pattern
9. Binary tree traversal -  Preorder, postorder or inorder
10. DFS or BFS
11. Dynamic programming
12.
